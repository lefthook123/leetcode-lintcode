Object Oriented design for Elevator in a multi-storied apartment

Below is the design for an elevator in a multi-storied building.

A typical lift has buttons(Elevator buttons) inside the cabin to let the user who got in the lift to select his/her desired floor.Similarly each floor has buttons (Floor buttons) to summon the lift to go floors above and floor below respectively. The buttons illuminate indicating the request is accepted. And the lift reaches the requested floor the button stops illuminating.

Use cases:
User

presses the floor button to summon the lift
presses the elevator button to make the lift move to the desired floor


Floor Button/Elevator Button

illuminates when pressed
places a elevator request when pressed
Elevator
Moves up/down as per instruction
Opens/closes the door
Each button press results in an elevator request which has to be served. Each of these requests is tracked at a global place. ElevatorRequests, the class which stores elevator requests can use different strategies to schedule the elevator requests. The elevator is controlled by a controller class which we call ElevatorController. The elevator controller instructs the elevator what to do and also can shutdown/start up the elevator of the building. The elevator controller reads the next elevator request to be processed and serves it.
